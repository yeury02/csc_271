        <p>Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. <br>
            Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. <br>
            But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.</p>

        <h2>Early history and the precursors of football</h2>
        <p>The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, <br>
            occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. According to the sources,<br> 
            the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods.</p>
        
        <p>The first known ball game which also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name Cuju.<br>
             Cuju was played with a round ball on an area of a square. It later spread to Japan and was practiced under ceremonial forms.</p>

        <p>Other earlier variety of ball games had been known from Ancient Greece. The ball was made by shreds of<br>
            leather filled with hair (the first documents of balls filled with air are from the 7th century).<br>
            In the Ancient Rome, games with balls were not included in the entertainment on the big arenas,<br>
             but could occur in exercises in the military. It was the Roman culture that would bring football to the British island (Britannica).<br>
             It is, however, uncertain in which degree the British people were influenced by this variety and in which degree they had developed
              their own variants.</p>
